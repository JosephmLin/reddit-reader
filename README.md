This is my first personal Side Project to build a chrome extension. The goal is to weed out any form of inside jokes on reddit and just stick to the real interesting comments. I find them boring, so hopefully this will help out.
<h1> Current Goal: Basic User Interface with this Chrome Extension </h1>
If a user downvotes a post, a small textbox may appear that says "Is this an inside joke or a pun thread?"
If the user clicks yes, then it will automatically collapse the thread. Once the user has clicked a response, the box disappears.

Things I've learned:
Content security for scripts on Chrome Extensions. Can't just add in any old script.
